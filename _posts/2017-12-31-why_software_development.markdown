I was the first member of my immediate family to graduate college. After graduating I began managing the government sales accounts for a family business. It was during this time that I was introduced to ISO certification, in order to maintain our status as a preferred vendor with a government contractor we needed to become ISO certified. Pursuing ISO certification and implementing solutions to obtain it is what lead me to discover my love for organizing data. I noticed that as a small business we had no efficient way of processing our orders and tracking the information required by ISO standard. As a result, I began researching software solutions that were currently on the market and found that very few met our needs and the few that did were significantly out of our price range. I was forced to develop my own solution and did so in the form of an Access database. I knew very little about databases and so I read a few books to learn a basis in order to achieve what was needed. After completing this project, I realized that if I had more knowledge of HTML, CSS, and MySQL I could have created a much more scalable version of what we needed. After that realization, I began learning as much as I could about computer programming and how to code. Working on the database and working with the data was the highlight of my day regardless of the fact that my limited knowledge was sometimes frustrating. I was forced to come up with creative solutions that bypassed the areas of code I did not understand. However, I also learned a lot about the structure of databases, table relationships and was briefly exposed to how MySQL code looks and how that translates into the storage and manipulation of data. As boring as it may sound to some, my passion is to find innovative and efficient ways to record, manage, organize and utilize data and my goal is to do this via code.

The discovery of this passion is what has lead me to enroll in the Flatiron Full Stack Web Development Online program and begin my adventure in software development.
